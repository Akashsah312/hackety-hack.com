15:00 <steveklabnik> hey everybody. for those of you who don't know me, I'm 
steve.
15:00 -!- EricMill1 [cfac90dd@gateway/web/freenode/ip.207.172.144.221] has 
joined #hacketyhack
15:00 <steveklabnik> thanks for showing up
15:00 <steveklabnik> oh hey EricMill1 
15:00 <steveklabnik> just in time.
15:00 <steveklabnik> anyway.
15:00 < EricMill1> Hey hey
15:01 <steveklabnik> I don't have hours and hours of stuff to say. I just wanted to tell you about some things that i've been working on, answer any questions about hackety, and invite anyone who's been thinking about helping out to lend a hand.
15:01 <steveklabnik> basically.
15:02 <steveklabnik> So, small recap of the story so far: it's been a little over a year since _why decided to leave, and I've taken over the project. in that year, I've done a little bit of work, and lately, done a lot.
15:02 -!- i5m [~i5m@109.224.129.236] has joined #hacketyhack
15:02 <steveklabnik> for those of you who didn't see, or dont know anything about me, i ran a tech startup company, but i've recently quit it : http://blog.steveklabnik.com/the-hardest-decision-ive-ever-made
15:03 <steveklabnik> and i'd like to work on hackety hack as close to full-time as possible.
15:03 <steveklabnik> but, it's not something i can or should do alone. I'd like to rebuild the community around hackety hack again.
15:04 <steveklabnik> so... that's largely you guys. :)
15:04 <steveklabnik> two things that are exciting in hackety's future: there's been some talk of me teaching intro to CS classes at my school with Hackety.
15:04 <steveklabnik> not a 100% given yet.
15:04 <steveklabnik> but it's a possiblility
15:04 <steveklabnik> #2 is that I'm working on a book.
15:05 -!- Burgestrand [~Adium@h-36-73.A155.priv.bahnhof.se] has joined #hacketyhack
15:05 <steveklabnik> I've also been teaching a little bit with hackety to students outside of the formal intro to cs kind of program
15:05 <steveklabnik> i ran two classes of 'intro to programming for english majors' and they were pretty well recieved.
15:06 <steveklabnik> so, that's what i've been up to.
15:06 <steveklabnik> and I'm only going to be doing more work going forward.
15:06 <steveklabnik> so.... what _should_ I be doing? what do you guys want to see from me?
15:06 <steveklabnik> how can I get your help?
15:06 < cls_> ^ a book on writing ruby with hackety, in hackety fasion, is that?
15:06 <steveklabnik> I think we've got something really good going on.

15:06 <steveklabnik> yep, it'd be "Learning Programming with Hackety Hack" or something similar
15:07 <steveklabnik> a basic introductory text.
15:07 -!- vintrepid [~vintrepid@adsl-76-212-9-255.dsl.pltn13.sbcglobal.net] has joined #hacketyhack
15:07 < wilkie> will this book be involved with this teaching intro to CS classes possibility?
15:07 <steveklabnik> maybe.
15:07 <steveklabnik> it depends.
15:07 -!- ashbb [7441418c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.116.65.65.140] has joined #hacketyhack
15:08 < krainboltgreene> Thing?
15:08 -!- Burgestrand [~Adium@h-36-73.A155.priv.bahnhof.se] has left 
#hacketyhack []
15:08 <steveklabnik> thing?
15:08 < krainboltgreene> Oh this is the summit.
15:08 < WecCoding4Fun> Steve, what age group is being targeted with Hackety?
15:08 < EricMill1> Lately, I've been teaching some 5th graders in the DC public 
school system how to make websites, basic HTML.
15:09 < wilkie> ashbb: welcome!
15:09 <steveklabnik> wilkie: Ideally, I'd like to focus on teenagers.
15:09 < EricMill1> Depending on how it goes, I would love to extend it to 
something like teaching 6th or 7th graders how to do CS/Ruby
15:09 <steveklabnik> argh
15:09 < EricMill1> and HH would be a great tool for that
15:09 <steveklabnik> not wilke, WecCoding4Fun 
15:09 <steveklabnik> ashbb: ! hey!
15:09 <steveklabnik> thanks for waking up early!
15:10 < EricMill1> regardless, my target audience for HH would be more like pre-teen
15:10 <steveklabnik> Anyway, Hackety Hack should be _useful_ for everyone.
15:10 < wilkie> EricMill1: sweet! I think it would be best to teach as early as possible. We need to improve the grade school CS education.
15:10 <steveklabnik> i dont want to be exclusionary.
15:10 < zzak> おはよう　さとし　さん！
15:10 < EricMill1> This is when children are more vulnerable to mind control.
15:10 < ashbb> Good morning. :)
15:10 < cls_> quick check, being from the uk, what ages is {5,6,7}th grade?
15:11 < mantycore> What should be done now/ For me, re/building community in itself seems to be most important for hackety now.
15:11 < EricMill1> oh sorry
15:11 < WecCoding4Fun> I've got 3 teenagers here (almost), 12, 14 and 18.  My 14 year old does things on the computer that simply amazes me.  It's a great age to pick up algorithms, problem solving, etc.
15:11 < EricMill1> between 10 and 13
15:11 <steveklabnik> I started when I was 7, personally.
15:11 < EricMill1> age = grade + 5 or 6
15:11 <steveklabnik> i think that children develop too differently to really box them in by age, you know?
15:11 < cls_> i started when i was 11, with windows xp and notepad. :/ i wouldhave *loved* hackety hack
15:11 < WecCoding4Fun> i was 14 when i started, just about 25 years ago now.
15:12 < wilkie> but if there is no exposure at all, yanno, that's not good either
15:12 < zzak> re: community building: hackety hack _needs_ to be available in more languages. i have some ideas how to make this transition
15:12 < krainboltgreene> Hackety Hack is less CS and more programming.
15:12 < WecCoding4Fun> (back when all computers did was flash OK when you turned them on) *wink*
15:13 <steveklabnik> There's also one big blocker bug to i18n: https://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/issues#issue/14
15:13 < wilkie> krainboltgreene: 1: print VIRUS 2: goto 1 :)
15:13 < cls_> what i want from HH, basically, is .. well, about a year ago i watched that presentation by _why on HH, at the.. art-and-code thing?
15:13 < wilkie> krainboltgreene: our intro to CS classes are generally intro to programming... so it fits the current expectation
15:13 < cls_> and it blew my mind. and i want everything he talked about to come true :p
15:14 <steveklabnik> cls_: yep, that's what it was. that happened about two miles from my house, actually.
15:14 < krainboltgreene> wilkie: Crazy.
15:14 -!- delinquentme [~delinquen@c-67-163-143-192.hsd1.pa.comcast.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
15:14 < cls_> btw, do you all know greenfoot?
15:14 < cls_> i bring it up because i go to the uni where they develop it. and it seems to me like hh-done-wrong
15:15 < WecCoding4Fun> "greenfoot", not familiar with that
15:15 <steveklabnik> i don't know greenfoot
15:15 < cls_> it's a java ide for kids
15:15 <steveklabnik> i largely see two 'hh-done-wrong' projects: scratch and alice.
15:15 < cls_> very graphical and such, like, yeah, scratch and alice
15:15 <steveklabnik> http://www.greenfoot.org/ <- this?
15:15 < WecCoding4Fun> Ah, there's a .NET project that is similar.
15:15 < cls_> yeah
15:15 < wilkie> cls_: interesting. any failures are good to acknowledge so as not to repeat
15:15 < wilkie> cls_: what is wrong with it?
15:16 <steveklabnik> WecCoding4Fun: have a link? I'm curious.
15:16 < WecCoding4Fun> let me see if i can dig it up.
15:16 < cls_> wilkie: it's generally a nice idea, but it's "objects-first", which is a whole java-oriented approach which invades childrens' minds :p
15:16 < cls_> whereas it should be more like, "make cool shit-first"
15:16 <steveklabnik> oh, and one more pretty big thing: I'm tentativly announcing HH 1.0 for Christmas.
15:18 < cls_> i think it has some nice ideas, though. what are your experiences with, say, a 2d canvas where you can move things around? i know hh has the art section, though i've not played with it
15:18 < WecCoding4Fun> .NET Programming for kids was call called KPL (Kids Programming Language).  It looks like it became something called Phrogram. http://phrogram.com/kpl.aspx
15:18 < cls_> steveklabnik: that is very soon :o think it's ready?
15:18 < mantycore> scratch, as I get it, is not a failure, it is just, well, wrong. From hh perspective ;)
15:18 <steveklabnik> cls_: have you played with it lately?
15:18 <steveklabnik> mantycore: yes. and their website is _fantastic_.
15:19 -!- delinquentme [~delinquen@c-67-163-143-192.hsd1.pa.comcast.net] has joined #hacketyhack
15:19 -!- i5m [~i5m@109.224.129.236] has quit [Quit: Colloquy for iPod touch - http://colloquy.mobi]
15:19 < cls_> steveklabnik: yeah. not a huge amount -- i'm lacking in time atm -- but enough to get the feeling, i think
15:19 <steveklabnik> everyone's just trying to do their best. I'd rather present a constructive "this is how we think we're better" than "they suck"
15:19 < cls_> i mean, it's definitely close. but there are a few tiny things i think
15:19 <steveklabnik> oh yeah.
15:20 <steveklabnik> I have work to do between now and then.
15:20 <steveklabnik> but it's all spit and polish.
15:20 < krainboltgreene> WEb version of HH.
15:20 < krainboltgreene> Broader audience, broader platform.
15:20 < cls_> krainboltgreene: has that been discussed here or on the ml?
15:20 < krainboltgreene> Hell if I know.
15:20 <steveklabnik> it's been suggested as long as HH has existed.
15:21 <steveklabnik> it would require a total re-write. something I'm not opposed to, but... seems counterproductive at the moment.
15:21 < zzak> one thing to keep in mind is that HH is currently built upon shoes: http://shoesrb.com/
15:21 < WecCoding4Fun> At least not before xmas :)
15:22 < krainboltgreene> Does HH have a command line component?
15:22 <steveklabnik> not really.
15:22 <steveklabnik> IRB is currently built in, but I was thinking about removing it.
15:22 <steveklabnik> I'm currently torn.
15:22 < cls_> steveklabnik: i'd like to look into a web version in a while. i'm extremely busy right now, but around christmas i'll suddenly have loads of time on my hands.
15:22 < mantycore> Built-in irb doesn't plays along with the rest of app.
15:22 <steveklabnik> exactly.
15:23 <steveklabnik> it feels out of place
15:23 <steveklabnik> cls_: cool. i'd certainly advise.
15:23 <steveklabnik> basically, it would be porting shoes to the web.
15:24 < zzak> maybe then, tryruby should be removed an instead launch a terminal session of irb
15:24 < WecCoding4Fun> I'm not very familiar with HH, but I have had some time to make available on open source and was looking for a project to contribute to.  Looks like HH is a good fit, it's for the youngin's  :)
15:24 < Shviller> mixing shous with markaby?
15:24 < Shviller> *shoes
15:25 <steveklabnik> Shviller: that may be one possiblity. porting desktop apps to be web apps is non-trivial
15:25 < cls_> Shviller: i would have expected something closer to sinatra-shoes 
(lots of puns available)
15:25 <steveklabnik> WecCoding4Fun: :)
15:25 <steveklabnik> anything I can do to make it easier to contribute, i will.
15:25 < WecCoding4Fun> where would you suggest I start?  reviewing issues on
15:25 < cls_> steveklabnik: a nice up-to-date list of small things to do would 
be good.
15:25 <steveklabnik> i think the marketing needs a little bit of work. for example, cls_, you asked me about the mailing list. I thought I had pointed it out fairly prominently on the site/github.
15:26 <steveklabnik> cls_: noted
15:26 <steveklabnik> WecCoding4Fun: Yes. GitHub issue reviews would be good.
15:26 <steveklabnik> they should be mostly up to date
15:27 < WecCoding4Fun> ok.  I'll start there then.
15:27 < mantycore> I think what the most important thing in hackety, code-vise, is the library and not the interface, so that's not porting desktop app to the web, but more of porting local-oriented library to be net-oriented.
15:27 <steveklabnik> also just playing with it, noting where there are problems, and reporting them helps, too.
15:27 < cls_> steveklabnik: i had a look and those i could find were either windows or osx specific (which i can't test) or seemed fixed when i tried to replicate. only one which wasn't was the floating highlight, which seemed.. harder than a first-hack
15:27 < WecCoding4Fun> Don't hate, but I'm on a Windows platform.  Would that cause any issues if I were contributing?
15:27 <steveklabnik> mantycore: true.
15:28 < zzak> windows contributors are always welcome!
15:28 < WecCoding4Fun> Excellent.
15:28 <steveklabnik> cls_: that's because I have a Mac, I teach on Windows, and so Linux specific bugs just aren't as highly reported.
15:28 <steveklabnik> absolutely.
15:28 <steveklabnik> in fact, windows is probably the most important platform
15:28 <steveklabnik> and one that I'm personally very weak at. :/
15:28 < cls_> as much as i want that not to be true, it is, yeah
15:29 < WecCoding4Fun> haha... then, together, we are the greater than the sum of its parts.
15:29 <steveklabnik> mantycore: one of the things i'd like to do is make the "Hackety Standard Library" a bit more obvious, and separate
15:29 < WecCoding4Fun> :)
15:29 <steveklabnik> because you're right, it is important.
15:30 <steveklabnik> another option for contributing to hackety hack is to contribute to Shoes.
15:30 < cls_> i wasn't aware there was such a thing :p
15:30 < zzak> have a look at the bowline project, uses webkit and you basically make web apps for the desktop. only supports mac and linux tho, so major drawback there and probably why it wasn't largely adopted.
15:30 <steveklabnik> since Hackety Hack is the largest shoes app, contributions to shoes also help hackety
15:30 <steveklabnik> now, shoes is really hard to contribute to at the moment.
15:30 < mantycore> Yes. And it's in lieu with ruby philosophy of building DSLs :)
15:30 <steveklabnik> but it's undergoing a re-write.
15:31 <steveklabnik> it seems pretty clear to me that green_shoes will be the next shoes: https://github.com/ashbb/green_shoes
15:31 <steveklabnik> ashbb has been working hard on it.
15:31 <steveklabnik> it's a pure-ruby shoes implementation
15:31 < EricMill1> Ripping out IRB is probably a good thing, especially if it causes much in the way of code complexity
15:31 < EricMill1> especially if there's a working web-based version
15:32 <steveklabnik> it's also not going to be 100% backwards compatible. so porting hackety to it will take some effort.
15:32 < EricMill1> hell, the app could simply embed the website in a frame
15:32 < cls_> steveklabnik: is hh likely to switch the green shoes in the future then?
15:32 <steveklabnik> EricMill1: good point.
15:32 < EricMill1> no need to dupe effort
15:32 < cls_> why is irb not wanted btw?
15:32 <steveklabnik> cls_: yes. or more accuratly, green shoes will become shoes 4, and so Hackety will move to it.
15:32 <steveklabnik> irb feels like it's tacked on.
15:33 <steveklabnik> also, it was originally put in because tryruby.org didn't exist.
15:33 < EricMill1> it also can be done more effectively from the cloud, I think
15:33 <steveklabnik> then why built that, and it never got moved out, basically.
15:33 < EricMill1> that's actually not true, _why built try ruby a long time ago I believe
15:33 < Shviller> Another problem with irb is that Windows' console is horrible.
15:33 < EricMill1> like before Ruby was super popular
15:33 <steveklabnik> oh yeah? I have my history wrong, then.
15:35 < EricMill1> yeah, I think he just wanted a quick native experience
15:35 < EricMill1> in HH
15:35 <steveklabnik> yeah.
15:35 <steveklabnik> another thing is that more lessons need to be written.
15:35 <steveklabnik> id like to develop a feature where people can write and share their own lessons.
15:35 <steveklabnik> the current hackety lessons are just the Try Ruby lessons, and the hackety tour.
15:35 < EricMill1> I see the value of built-in lessons, especially for letting kids explore
15:36 < zzak> it would help if hh and the website where more closely connected
15:36 < krainboltgreene> :)
15:36 < EricMill1> but for me, I know I'd be using a central space to guide the lessons, like a whiteboard or screen
15:36 < cls_> oh, that would be nice. i noticed in the olpc project a lot of teachers wrote their own lessons and stuff for programs, so it would be nice to encourage that
15:36 < EricMill1> I could teach lessons with HH without anything built in
15:36 < cls_> might gain more acceptance in schools? maybe
15:36 < zzak> i like the idea of being able to create an account through HH, either oauth or directly
15:36 -!- kuremmu [~kuremmu@adsl-99-181-106-151.dsl.sfldmi.sbcglobal.net] has left #hacketyhack []
15:36 <steveklabnik> EricMill1: where would this guidance be from? I'm not 100% sure i'm seeing it
15:36 < zzak> and then having a place, like steve said, to share and browse lessons
15:37 <steveklabnik> zzak: yes!
15:37 <steveklabnik> I do think that even with community lessons, there still should be blessed hackety lessons. that come with it.
15:37 < EricMill1> I mean that I'd be in a classroom environment
15:37 < EricMill1> doing the teaching up front
15:37 < zzak> people should be able to maintain an amount of settings in their account through HH or the website as well. such as: "disable hh intro animation" and language settings
15:37 <steveklabnik> ah. okay. that'd be why, then.
15:38 <steveklabnik> zzak also a good idea.
15:38 < cls_> are there a lot of lessons not included in the git repo btw? i just saw a lot of things to do with cats. (the names aren't very descriptive either ;)
15:39 < zzak> you could have "featured" teachers on the site, and people could also follow individuals to get notified when they release a new lesson
15:39 <steveklabnik> you were thinking of samples: https://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/tree/master/samples
15:39 <steveklabnik> (and you're right, those should be changed)
15:39 < cls_> zzak: yeah, that might be nice.
15:39 <steveklabnik> we're talking about lessons: https://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/tree/master/lessons
15:39 < cls_> (though i do *love* the intro animation >.>)
15:39 < cls_> steveklabnik: oh, i did look at both, my memory must have just merged them :p
15:40 <steveklabnik> no worries.
15:40 <steveklabnik> we have the great shoes-contrib project to grab some fun examples from too.
15:40 < zzak> i like steves idea of having users code in git repositories as well, lessons could be maintained in a similar fashion
15:40 -!- nothingHappens [~nothingHa@173-22-90-249.client.mchsi.com] has joined #hacketyhack
15:40 < nothingHappens> sry i'm late
15:41 <steveklabnik> no worries nothingHappens, welcome.
15:41 < mantycore> EricMill1, built-in lessons are very vaulable for autodidacts and for other cases of learning outside of schools
15:41 < cls_> wrt the *actual* lessons, have there been any thoughts making it more like how cucumber works? with natural language? might help people write them? then again it might not.
15:42 <steveklabnik> the DSL is pretty simple already.
15:42 < zzak> the lessons could very well move to YAML or something similar to format with an i18n possibility
15:42 < wilkie> EricMill1: I'd say that a course lesson plan is different from this context... but it would be nice to say, have a book _and_ a lesson plan, eh?
15:42 < EricMill1> Oh of course, as I said, I recognize the lessons would be very valuable
15:42 < EricMill1> I'm just saying that a classroom environment wouldn't depend on them
15:42 < WecCoding4Fun> Who are we targeting for doing the teaching?  standard teachers?
15:42 < cls_> steveklabnik: yeah, i'm having a look at it now. it does lookquite simple. just thinking cuke-like might be even nicer. i might be wrong though
15:43 <steveklabnik> i'm not sure either. it could, it could not.
15:43 < EricMill1> what I'd be looking for in evaluating it for use in a classroom would be stability, and basic social features like sharing programs and data
15:43 <steveklabnik> WecCoding4Fun: not entirely sure. ideally, anyone could be a 'teacher'
15:44 < WecCoding4Fun> yes, but not all teachers are tech-savy enough to use something likt GitHub. :)
15:44 < WecCoding4Fun> *like* GitHub I mean.
15:44 < zzak> hh could handle most of the heavy lifting of the git api
15:44 <steveklabnik> true. my ultimate plan for the site is to make it like a mini-github. super simple. same general idea.
15:44 <steveklabnik> let people share and collaborate.
15:44 < zzak> i love githubs api
15:44 < WecCoding4Fun> Most teachers I know are still stuck to their agenda-bsaed lesson plans.
15:45 < cls_> does hh have integrated messaging yet? i didn't see it when i looked
15:45 < WecCoding4Fun> Argh, I can't type today. :S
15:45 <steveklabnik> it does, actually.
15:46 <steveklabnik> well, its not integrated into the application, 
15:46 <steveklabnik> only on the site itself.
15:46 <steveklabnik> we pulled messages from the app.
15:46 <steveklabnik> they could be put back in, i just didnt like the implementation at the time.
15:47 < cls_> i ought to uh, make an account so i can see the full feature set :p
15:47 <steveklabnik> :)
15:47 <steveklabnik> it's not impressive yet.
15:47 <steveklabnik> the website is another way to contribute, too.
15:47 <steveklabnik> it needs a lot of loving as well.
15:47 <steveklabnik> what I have is very simplistic at the moment.
15:48 <steveklabnik> what's nice about the site is that it has reasonable test coverage. :)
15:48 <steveklabnik> better testing for the application would be nice.
15:48 <steveklabnik> and easier to write if we pull the stdlib out from the ide.
15:48 < cls_> is the preferences section supposed to be broken?
15:48 <steveklabnik> ... on the site? or in the app?
15:48 < cls_> app
15:49 <steveklabnik> no. what's "broken"?
15:49 < cls_> it asked for my details, i hit save, it said, hello! click here. i clicked here. i entered my settings. i hit save. hello.....
15:50 < cls_> s/settings/details
15:50 <steveklabnik> ah. so it's not so much broken as communicating badly.
15:50 < cls_> oh, is it asking me to *change* my user/pass there..?
15:50 <steveklabnik> the only thing in prefs right now is username-password
15:50 <steveklabnik> yeah.
15:50 < cls_> ohhh. yeah, that's very confusing :p
15:50  * steveklabnik is busy filing tickets about all of this on the Issues.
15:50 <steveklabnik> there used to be more stuff in there, now it's gone.
15:51 <steveklabnik> see, this is why I need you guys :)
15:51 < cls_> lol
15:51 < WecCoding4Fun> steveklabinik: what's the best way to contact you if we have contributions, suggestions, etc?
15:51 < zzak> tinker, hack, break stuff!
15:51 < cls_> what's the contribution cycle like though? fork & pull request?
15:51 <steveklabnik> WecCoding4Fun: first of all, the best way would be to post to the maling list.
15:51 <steveklabnik> that way it's public
15:52 < nothingHappens> ooh yeah. tyalk about contributing
15:52 <steveklabnik> but you can always jump on here. i'm idling 24/7, i'll get back to you if i'm gone at the time
15:52 < nothingHappens> i don'
15:52 <steveklabnik> cls_, nothingHappens: yes. fork, pull request.
15:52 <steveklabnik> also, steve+hackety@steveklabnik.com is my email, too
15:53 < cls_> ok. time to work out how to use github ;p
15:53 <steveklabnik> but really, the mailing list ( hacketyhack@librelist.com) is best, that way everyone can discuss
15:53 <steveklabnik> cls_: check it out:
15:53 <steveklabnik> https://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/wiki/Contributing-to-Hackety-Hack
15:53 <steveklabnik> this is the contribution guide
15:54 <steveklabnik> this links to this page: https://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/wiki/Just-Enough-Git
15:54 <steveklabnik> which explains some git stuff
15:54 < cls_> steveklabnik: thanks. hopefully git is similar to hg
15:55 <steveklabnik> its pretty close, ish.
15:55 <steveklabnik> at least in basic usage
15:55 < zzak> cls_: i've heard people find dthe switch rather easily
15:56 < wilkie> cls_: it is very close, same functionality... lots of articles that compare the two
15:56 < wilkie> cls_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35837/what-is-the-difference-between-mercurial-and-git

15:58 < WecCoding4Fun> ok.  I've forked it (as OakRaven)
15:58 <steveklabnik> :)
15:59 <steveklabnik> the website is https://github.com/hacketyhack/hackety-hack.com/
15:59 <steveklabnik> if anyone's interested in playing with that.
16:00 < cls_> ooh, sinatra. does it have an api?
16:00 < cls_> (for dealing with settings, uploads, etc)
16:00 < mantycore> Sadly, I should to go, so I'll stress my point once again: for hh community to grow, we need more strong image. So, word-of-mouth, conference talks, web or even paper publications, etc. are very important. Two years ago, hh was porered by _why's charisma; now we need to develop it charisma of its own :)
16:01 < cls_> once 1.0 comes out, i think we'll be able to do more of that.
16:01 < cls_> but yes, i agree
16:01 <steveklabnik> mantycore: point taken. I'm going to be trying to work on that
16:01 <steveklabnik> and yeah cls_, I agree. 1.0 is important, so that there's something to actually talk about
16:02 <steveklabnik> drop by whenever you have the time! Say Hi on the mailing list!
16:03 -!- squidca [46325ba0@gateway/web/freenode/ip.70.50.91.160] has joined #hacketyhack
16:03 <steveklabnik> hey squidca, good to see you
16:03 < squidca> thx
16:04 <steveklabnik> so i think i need to make it a bit more obvious how to get going.
16:04 <steveklabnik> too many clicks to get to the contriutions docs, for example.
16:05 < zzak> this is true
16:06 < zzak> you definitely have some real estate on the home page for more information
16:06 <steveklabnik> designing on a laptop has its good and its bad points.
16:07 < zzak> true :_
16:07 < zzak> :)
16:09 <steveklabnik> so... cool. I don't have a whole ton of other stuff to bring up, really. for those of you that missed my first little bit, I'm going to be trying to work on this as close to full-time as I can.
16:09 <steveklabnik> i've got a book and some teaching in the works.
16:10 <steveklabnik> you can always hang out here, i'm idling all the time.there's also the mailing list at hacketyhack@librelist.com
16:10 <steveklabnik> aaaand anything I can do to help anyone, just let me know :)
16:10 < WecCoding4Fun> <-- Just joined mailing list :)
16:11 <steveklabnik> i jsut got your email to my phone ;)
16:11 < WecCoding4Fun> Scarey
16:11 < WecCoding4Fun> :)
16:11 < ashbb> What is different HH v1.0-pre from v1.0?
16:11 <steveklabnik> looking at your last tweet, you should check out the specs for the hackety site. I used steak. good stuff.
16:12 <steveklabnik> hey ashbb ! basically, I want to remove Try Ruby, because I think that it doesn't fit. I need to take care of this issue: https://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/issues#issue/14 if possible for non-american users, and some general clean up kinds of things
16:12 < WecCoding4Fun> I will definitely check out steak
16:12 <steveklabnik> the preference pane is a bit confusing, the example programs could be better, and a triple-check of the wording of the lessons.
16:13 < zzak> are you going to accept any new features pre or post release?
16:13 -!- mantycore [~mantycore@109-184-7-205.dynamic.mts-nn.ru] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
16:14 <steveklabnik> not pre, but post, for sure.
16:14 < zzak> like maybe a 1.1?
16:14 <steveklabnik> squidca, I just merged in your pull request.
16:14 < squidca> oh, good
16:15 < squidca> is there a roadmap, or anything like that?
16:15 <steveklabnik> but yeah ashbb, not a ton of new changes. mostly just polish.
16:15 <steveklabnik> https://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/wiki/Roadmap
16:15 <steveklabnik> a tiny one.
16:15 <steveklabnik> it needs updated.
16:16 < WecCoding4Fun> I have to run, supper's ready.  I'll leave XChat running so I don't miss anything.  :)
16:16 <steveklabnik> :) enjoy
16:16 < WecCoding4Fun> thnx
16:16 <steveklabnik> i will try to post an updated roadmap later tonight.
16:17 < squidca> I have to lurk for a bit too :(
16:18 < ashbb> I see. Then, what is HH? IMHO, HH is a "Try Shoes" for kids.
16:18 <steveklabnik> yes.
16:18 <steveklabnik> it's a Shoes IDE.
16:19 <steveklabnik> with lessons to help you get better at programming.
16:19 <steveklabnik> it also has some extra things on top of Shoes, too. An extended library.
16:21 < zzak> HH is to shoes as rails is to ruby
16:21 < ashbb> An extended library... What does it refer to?
16:22 <steveklabnik> https://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/tree/master/lib
16:22 -!- i5m [~i5m@109.224.129.236] has joined #hacketyhack
16:22 <steveklabnik> extra stuff on top of shoes.
16:23  * krainboltgreene boff.
16:24 < zzak> i love reopening classes :)
16:24 < krainboltgreene> Someone really needs to make a syntax highlighter with Ruby.
16:25 <steveklabnik> what do you mean?
16:25 < ashbb> I see. We usually call them "tiny Shoes apps". :)
16:28 < krainboltgreene> steveklabnik: See: Pygmints
16:28 < zzak> https://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/blob/master/lib/enhancements.rb#L34 for example
16:29 <steveklabnik> ah. okay. but why written in ruby, though?
16:29 <steveklabnik> and hackety has the beginnings of one, it does do code highlighting. ;)
16:30 < cls_> zzak: i've heard that described as "duck punching"
16:30 < zzak> haha, or monkey patching
16:32 < ashbb> "HH is to shoes as rails is to ruby".... Interesting!
16:32 < ashbb> Shoes is on desktop, Rails is on web.
16:33 < zzak> this is true
16:33 < cls_> i'd say just, hh is to shoes what try ruby is to ruby
16:34 < zzak> the thing about rails tho, it has activesupport which is like "enhancments" to ruby in order for rails to function as it does
16:35 < zzak> it's also that "killer app" for ruby, which has a lot of great code in it and examples of how to do things in ruby
16:35 <steveklabnik> true.
16:35 < zzak> you can often look at hh for ideas in shoes
16:36 -!- sarah0101 [~sarah0101@96-39-11-34.static.oxfr.ma.charter.com] has joined #hacketyhack
16:36 <steveklabnik> yeah. i think moving the hh-library out from the ide makes a lot of sense.
16:36 <steveklabnik> just like rails has activesupport.
16:36 < krainboltgreene> Agreed.
16:36 -!- krainboltgreene [~krainbolt@c-71-56-157-7.hsd1.wa.comcast.net] has left #hacketyhack ["Leaving"]
16:36 <steveklabnik> especially when we move to green shoes
16:36 < cls_> can you summarise what the hhlib *does*?
16:36 -!- krainboltgreene [~krainbolt@c-71-56-157-7.hsd1.wa.comcast.net] has joined #hacketyhack
16:36 <steveklabnik> because then they'll all just be gems. and they can pull each other in easily.
16:36 < sarah0101> i dont get this program at all
16:37 < sarah0101> im trying to hack skype
16:37 <steveklabnik> cls_: basically, adds some nice sugar on top of usual ruby stuff
16:37 < krainboltgreene> steveklabnik: Why Ruby? Because right now it's just ruby gems that point to Pygments.
16:37 <steveklabnik> sarah0101: that's not what we're talking about, sorry.
16:37 <steveklabnik> we can't help you with that.
16:37 <steveklabnik> krainboltgreene: fair enough, just curious.
16:37 < krainboltgreene> Because I need more unfinished projects, that's why.
16:37 < zzak> hehe
16:38 < zzak> look at nex3's rb-pygments
16:38 < krainboltgreene> Will do.
16:38 < zzak> theres plenty of wrappers, but thats probably a decent starting place
16:38 <steveklabnik> cls_: think of them like "shoes helpers". nicer errors, for example. the internal evnet tracking system.
16:38 <steveklabnik> ^event
16:39 <steveklabnik> the sound foley and the art drawing program
16:39 -!- sarah0101 [~sarah0101@96-39-11-34.static.oxfr.ma.charter.com] has quit [Client Quit]
16:40 < cls_> steveklabnik: ah, i see. art/ seems a little out of place in thatdir though. like, it's all punching ducks except for art/, which is a bunch of shoes sub-apps
16:41 <steveklabnik> yeah. that may or may not be in the right place.
16:41 <steveklabnik> i'm thinking not, now
16:42 <steveklabnik> because that's really part of the ide.
16:42 -!- stwerner [~stwerner@72.95.222.185] has quit [Quit: stwerner]
16:42 < cls_> yeah, that's what i'm thinking
16:44 < ashbb> Rails is a tool for creating website in 15 minutes. Shoes is a tool for creating Graphical desktop app in 15 minutes.
16:44 < zzak> :)
16:45 < cls_> personally i think rails is a bit big for a 15 minute app
16:45 < cls_> sinatra is way quicker
16:45 < zzak> it can be done tho
16:46 < cls_> it can. it just might not be best :P
16:46 <steveklabnik> '15 minutes' was the orignal pitch
16:46 <steveklabnik> it's really about 'full stack' vs. 'the basics'
16:46 < zzak> yar
16:46 < ashbb> cls_: true. :)
16:48 -!- MegaDeus [MegaDeus@adsl-99-140-173-35.dsl.chcgil.sbcglobal.net] has joined #hacketyhack
16:50 < squidca> sorry, is hacketyhack meant to be a way to learn about shoes/ruby, or an ide (not that it can't be both)
16:50 <steveklabnik> a way to learn about programming, via ruby.
16:51 < squidca> that's what I thought.
16:51 <steveklabnik> it accomplishes this by being a very simple IDE.
16:51 <steveklabnik> and having awesome tutorials/help system.
16:52 < ashbb> And Sinatra (Rails) is a tool for learning Ruby programming. HH (Shoes) is a tool as the same with lots of fun.
16:53 < zzak> :) i really love the hackety hack turtle
16:53 <steveklabnik> yeah, fela did a great job
16:55 < squidca> ashbb: I guess that's where my confusion lies.  I don't think of rails as a tool for learning ruby, I think of it as a tool for creating websites :)
16:55 < squidca> so I was wondering if this meant hh was becoming a tool for doing something
16:56 < zzak> squidca, its because many peoples first experience with ruby is rails. and also it's probably the largest ruby apps around
16:57 < zzak> not to mention the most widely used
16:57 < krainboltgreene> Sinatra's making it's way to the top.
16:58 < squidca> yes, I understand it is a good gateway to ruby (mine too), butultimately it's goal isn't to teach people ruby.  and so, if hh's goal was, for instance, to allow people to easily build shoes apps, that might look like a different thing than an app to teach
16:58 < squidca> anyway, I thnk we're all talking about the same thing :)
16:58 < zzak> that may not be its goal, but it is certainly a side effect
16:59 < zzak> it depends on what type of app you're building, you may want to take advanted of some of hh's features to build your shoes app
16:59 < zzak> or maybe you're comfortable enough to just use an editor of your choice and start hacking away
16:59 < zzak> but i dont think hh's goal is to be "the shoes IDE" at all
17:00 < ashbb> squidca: Oh, okay. Restate. Rails is a trigger for learning Ruby.
17:00 < squidca> that's what I'm saying
17:00 < ashbb> Yes.
17:00 < zzak> its the rabbit hole
17:01 < squidca> I think of hh as a "ruby/shoes lesson ide"
17:01 < squidca> the rabbit hole is awesome
17:02 < squidca> basically, get someone interested in coding, show them how awesome it can be, and give them multiple paths to a next step
17:02 < squidca> (shoes, rails, sinatra or whatev)
17:02 <steveklabnik> i'll brb, i promised the girlfriend i'd get some food with her.
17:02 < cls_> with all these rabbit hole references you'd think we were talking about alice :p
17:02 < squidca> maybe that can be a lesson title :)
17:03 < zzak> yah, maybe not because of the alice reference
17:04 < zzak> okay steve, i might be afk by the time you get back. but thanks again for putting this together!
17:04 < squidca> yes, thanks steve
17:06 < ashbb> I'm glad HH also becomes a trigger for learning Ruby with lots
of fun.
17:06 < squidca> i had an idea for a series of lessons where you start with something easy, like the downloading example in the tour, then start peeling back the layers, showing the lower level code as you go
17:07 < squidca> maybe you start with a function that is purposefully buggy, then show how that method is made of other methods, and you eventually fix the code
17:08 < zzak> squidca: are you familiar with ruby_koans?
17:08 < squidca> yes, I love those
17:09 < zzak> you could use testunit or something similar in the background to test your methods
17:09 < squidca> something like that, but using all the hh stuff
17:09 < squidca> teaching testing would be cool too
17:09 < zzak> the tests start as failing, but then when the code gets fixed it reruns tests
17:09 < squidca> exactly!
17:10 < zzak> yes
17:10 < zzak> you could try implementing autotest in it too
17:10 < zzak> so once their file is saved it runs the associated tests
17:10 < zzak> thats a pretty interesting idea
17:13 < squidca> so anyway, that's kind of what I think of for HH - a way that "teachers" can write ruby lessons and "students" can play with them
17:14 < zzak> awesome
17:14 < zzak> i think this kind of discussion is exactly what hh needs
17:14 < zzak> either in irc or on the ML
17:14 < squidca> I have to go (time to eat).  steve, is there some way we can 
get a transcript of this summit?
17:15 < squidca> yeah, I think this is great
17:15 < zzak> i too have to take off
17:15 < squidca> nice to meet you all, I'm sure we'll talk soon
17:15 < zzak> the feelings mutual

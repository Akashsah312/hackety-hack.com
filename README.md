[hackety-hack.com][hh.com] is the web backend powering the collaborative features of [Hackety Hack][hh]. It is written in Rails 3 and continues to be under active development (see 'Helping Out'), the switch to Rails 3 happened quite recently so there's still lots to be done.

## Helping Out ##

If you have any experience writing Rails apps, feel free to help out, we're open to pull requests as long as you follow a few conditions.

+ **Test your code**, we really can't stress this enough, ideally you should be practicing [TDD][tdd] and writing tests before you even write your code. If you don't test your code, we have no way of knowing if it works properly so please do test.
+ **If it's a major feature, file an issue**, if you file an issue we can discuss certain aspects of the new feature with you and ensure it's a good fit for hackety-hack.com.

Additionally, if you're _not_ a developer and you have a feature you'd really like to see on the site, file an issue and we'll be sure to look into it on your behalf.

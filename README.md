# Hackety-Hack.com Generated Documentation

This is the automatically generated documentation for [the hackety-hack.com repository](http://github.com/hacketyhack/hackety-hack.com/). It's generated by running `rake dox` from the master branch.

We use [docco](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco) to do this, which is pretty cool.
